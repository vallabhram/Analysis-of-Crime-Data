# Analysis-of-Crime-Data
Welcome to the Econometrics Project repository! This project involves the analysis of crime data using various econometric techniques and statistical methods.


**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze crime data to understand the factors influencing crime rates over time. The dataset used in this project contains information on violent crime, murder, and robbery rates, along with various socio-economic and demographic variables.


**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is stored in Stata format (.dta) and contains the following variables:
- year: Year of observation
- vio: Violent crime rate
- mur: Murder rate
- rob: Robbery rate
- Other socio-economic and demographic variables

- 
**Project Structure**

The project is structured as follows:
- Loading and Summarizing Data: The dataset is loaded into R using the haven package, and a summary of the variables is provided.
- Data Visualization: Various plots and visualizations are created to explore the relationships between different variables.
- Statistical Analysis:
- Correlation analysis is performed to identify relationships between variables.
- Best Subset Selection: Best subset selection is performed to identify the most relevant variables for predicting crime rates.
- Fixed Effects Models: Fixed-effects models are estimated to analyze the impact of socio-economic factors on crime rates.
- Results and Interpretation: The results of the analysis are interpreted and discussed.
- Conclusion: A conclusion is drawn based on the findings of the analysis.


**Usage**

To run the R scripts in this project:
- Install the necessary R packages (haven, corrplot, GGally, ggplot2, leaps, dplyr, plm).
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Set the working directory to the directory containing the R scripts.
- Run each script in R or RStudio.
